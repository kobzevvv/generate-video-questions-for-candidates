You are generating one interview question to verify mandatory requirements for a role.

Language of output: {language}

Input job description:
{job_description}

Your task:
1. Identify the mandatory or must-have requirements in the job description (e.g. years of experience, specific certifications, location requirements, language skills).
2. Generate ONE interview question asking the candidate to simply confirm they possess these requirements.

The question must:
- politely explain that confirming these requirements helps ensure we're aligned
- clearly list or reference the key must-have skills or qualifications
- ask the candidate to confirm yes or no if they meet them
- NOT ask for examples or stories (that comes in a later question)
- keep it short — just a confirmation check
- sound polite, respectful and non-threatening
- avoid sounding like a test or interrogation
- be suitable for spoken video format
- be concise and natural
- avoid corporate or bureaucratic tone
- avoid directly referencing the job description text
- produce only one question

Output only the final question text.
